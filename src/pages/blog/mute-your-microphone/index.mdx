When you’re on a video call, especially with more than one other person, it really helps to mute your microphone when you’re not talking. You’d be surprised at the amount of noise the other end is hearing from you—they can hear you munching on those chips away from the mic, or sipping your coffee/mezcal. And if there are people talking in the same room as you the others on the call can probably hear them as clearly as they can hear you.

So! To mute your microphone, click on the microphone icon, or press command + shift + a `⌘ + ⇧ + a` in Zoom, and command + d `⌘ + d` in Google Meet (`alt + a`, `ctrl + d` respectively in Windows/Linux). You can also hold down the spacebar in zoom to temporarily mute or unmute, like a walkie-talkie.

To record, in Zoom hit the record button, and in Google Meet hit the record button which is hidden under the menu icon, see the video for details. In Zoom if you're not the host you’ll need to ask the host to record for you, and in Google Meet if you’re not the host they will receive an email after the meeting with a link to the video, which they can share with you.
