At work we use [Google Workspace][1] (formerly known as G Suite), and I will often want to quickly create a doc to share while I'm on a video call.

I used to go to `drive.google.com`, click New, then click the type of document, typically a Google Doc.

Then, one day, I was given a tip that changed my life. My friend and fellow developer Guilherme was on a call with me, and said "Next time, just go to [doc.new][2]". I thought, no, that black magic can't possibly exist.

It does! You can use the following shortcuts to create a new document, spreadsheet, presentation, or form.

* Document: [doc.new][2]
* Spreadsheet: [sheet.new][3]
* Presentation: [slide.new][4]
* Form: [form.new][5]

I can't imagine needing to very urgently create a Google Form, but it's there if you need it. The plural version of each of these works, too ([`docs`][6], [`sheets`][7], [`slides`][8], [`forms`][9]), and you can also type out the entire document type if you want to spend extra time creating your docs ([`document`][10], [`spreadsheet`][11], [`presentation`][12] apart from form, because the long/full version of `form` is, well, `form`.

Note that if you create a new document using one of these links but don't type anything in the document, it won't be saved. This prevents a Google Drive full of untitled documents.

The official Google support documentation for these shortcuts is [here][13], filed under "Beginner tips". Thanks Google for making me feel great. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
