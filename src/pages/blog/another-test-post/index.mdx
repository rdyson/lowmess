Years ago, I deleted my [Last.fm](https://last.fm) account, because it felt like a dying social media network. Months ago, I created [a new one](https://www.last.fm/user/lowmess), because Last.fm is a treasure trove of behaviorally generated personal data. It's a lovely service for a developer to have around for side projects, as it provides instant and easy access to a large dataset with a particularly personal connection if you're a music lover. In the process of using it for [one of those side projects](/about/), I found a dark & disturbing secret: Last.fm actually kind of sucks for tracking album plays.

Fair warning: things are about to take a turn for the opinionated, pedantic, and downright trivial.
